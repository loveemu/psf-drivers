Dragon Quest VII: Sound Engine Analysis
=======================================

This is a technical analysis note of the sound engine of PS1 Dragon Quest VII.

DQVII uses a custom sound engine, developed by Heart Beat.
PS1 Dragon Quest IV also uses the same sound engine.

Note: I used Japanese version of Dragon Quest VII (SLPM-86500)

File Formats
------------

DQVII CD has only 2 files, actually.
One is named as "SLPM_865.00", it's the main PSX-EXE file. Sound program is a part of it.
The other one is named as "HBD1PS1D.Q71". It's a large file archive.
Sound data (sequences and instruments) are stored in the archive.

I made a utility called "psdq7rip", which is able to rip all sound files out from the archive.
Over 7000+ files will be extracted. Sounds awful! In fact, most of them are duplicated.
I strongly recommend to remove unwanted copies by using a cleanup utility. (say, FileHammer)

Sound file is designed as follows:

|Offset|Size|Description                                                             |
|------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0x00|   4|SEQ size (could be 0)                                                   |
|  0x04|   2|SEQ id (msq_id)                                                         |
|  0x06|   1|Instrument bank count (usually 4)                                       |
|  0x07|   1|Load position # (Normal BGM specifies 0; loads to constant address)     |
|  0x08|   4|Reserved (probably not used)                                            |
|  0x0c|   4|Instrument bank #1 - PSX-ADPCM (aka VB) size (if 0, use preloaded bank) |
|  0x10|   4|Instrument bank #1 - Instrument attributes size                         |
|  0x14|   2|Instrument bank #1 - unknown                                            |
|  0x16|   2|Instrument bank #1 - unknown                                            |
|  0x18|  12|Instrument bank #2 - same as above                                      |
|  0x24|  12|Instrument bank #3 - same as above (cannot be used)                     |
|  0x30|  12|Instrument bank #4 - same as above (cannot be used)                     |
|  0x3c|   n|Data (SEQ, ADPCM, Instrument header)                                    |

It can have both of sequences and instruments in one file.
However, the game seems to load all waveforms (in a single file) before Enix logo,
then, it loads a sequence file (Overture for example) which contains no waveforms.

Our goal: load 2 sound files without CD, then start music playback

Difficulties And Solutions
--------------------------

- Sound loader function reads data from CD little by little.
  It sadly does not load the entire file into main memory at one time.
- Need to find a large free space to put waveforms. (432,800 bytes)

Sound Loader Function
---------------------

Function for loading a sound file is located at 0x80082598 (I named it as mopen_file).
The function loads ADPCM to SPU (if present), then loads a SEQ (if present).
The function takes only one argument, a pointer to a struct. It's something like a FILE*.
It manages current file offset, number of bytes need to be transfered,
number of bytes transfered in the last operation, buffer address, and so on.

Specifically, it is designed as follows:

|Offset|Size|Description                                                             |
|------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0x00|   4|Pointer to a struct, the first argument of open_file                    |
|  0x04|   4|-                                                                       |
|  0x08|   4|Pointer?                                                                |
|  0x0c|   4|Pointer?                                                                |
|  0x10|   4|-                                                                       |
|  0x14|   4|[O] Data buffer, file data will be stored to this buffer                |
|  0x18|   4|[O] Number of bytes transfered in the last operation                    |
|  0x1c|   4|[I] Number of bytes need to be transfered                               |
|  0x20|   4|Another buffer pointer?                                                 |
|  0x24|   4|Unknown                                                                 |
|  0x28|   4|Unknown                                                                 |
|  0x2c|   4|-                                                                       |
|  0x30|   2|-                                                                       |
|  0x32|   2|-                                                                       |
|  0x34|   4|-                                                                       |
|  0x38|   4|-                                                                       |
|  0x3c|   4|Pointer?                                                                |
|  0x40|   4|Pointer?                                                                |
|  0x44|   4|-                                                                       |
|  0x48|   4|-                                                                       |
|  0x4c|   4|-                                                                       |

It is also passed to a CD reader function located at 0x800769CC. (I named it as mread_cd)

mopen_file reads data from CD little by little.
It sadly does not load the entire file into main memory at one time.

mopen_file is a sort of subfunctions of the function located at 0x80076040. (I named it as open_file)
mopen_file seems to be called if the file type (or whatever a 16bit value) is 0x13.

mopen_file takes only one argument, a pointer to a struct. It's something for specifying a file.

Specifically, it is designed as follows:

|Offset|Size|Description                                                             |

|  0x04|   2|File type (0x13 for sound)                                              |
|  0x06|   2|-                                                                       |
|  0x08|   4|Offset?                                                                 |
|  0x0c|   4|Offset?                                                                 |

Hack PSX-EXE for PSF
--------------------

I decided to hack the original sound function before applying the PSF-o-Cycle driver code.
It was just like a reprogramming rather than a ripping.

Changes:

- Modify mopen_file for PSF
    - Change argument: $a0 is changed to a RAM address that points to the top of a sound file
    - Use memcpy instead of mread_cd (both of them are not used for SEQ,
      since the driver does not need to copy it to a specific location)
    - Minimize buffer size for DMA 4 from 2064 * 20 bytes to 2064 bytes
      (save memory space, and make the code simpler)
    - Load SEQ from preloaded area directly, regardless of file header contents
    - Always call mopenplay_seq after SEQ load (original driver do it only for normal BGM SEQ)

PSF Driver
----------

The structure is quite simple.

- dq7.psflib: music driver (altered SLPM_865.00) + instrument file
- dq7-xx.minipsf: sequence file

Instrument file and sequence file are located to constant address.
The location is specified by PSF-o-Cycle driver code.

- Sequence starts from 0x80138000
- Instrument starts from 0x80180000

A sequence file can be converted to PSF1 by using [bin2psf1](https://github.com/loveemu/bin2psf1).
The tool is especially good for batch conversion.
